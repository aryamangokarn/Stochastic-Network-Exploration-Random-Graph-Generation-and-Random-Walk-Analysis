# Stochastic Network Exploration: Random Graph Generation and Random Walk Analysis

This repository presents a comprehensive exploration of stochastic network models, focusing on the generation of random graphs and the analysis of random walks on these networks. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with the implementation and evaluation of various random graph models, as well as the study of random walk dynamics and their applications, such as PageRank and personalized PageRank algorithms.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main sections:

1. **Random Graph Generation**: This section focuses on generating random networks using different models, including the Erdős-Rényi (ER) model and the preferential attachment model. It explores the properties of these networks, such as degree distributions, connected components, and community structure.

2. **Random Walk Analysis**: In this section, you will simulate random walks on the generated networks and analyze their behavior. This includes studying the distance traveled by the walker, the degree distribution of visited nodes, and the influence of network properties on the random walk dynamics.

3. **PageRank and Personalized PageRank**: The final section introduces the PageRank algorithm, which is used by search engines to rank the importance of web pages. You will implement and analyze the PageRank algorithm, as well as explore personalized PageRank, where the user's interest is taken into account in the ranking process.

## Key Features

- **Erdős-Rényi (ER) Model**: Generate and analyze ER random networks, including degree distributions, connectivity, and the emergence of the giant connected component.
- **Preferential Attachment Model**: Implement the preferential attachment model for generating scale-free networks and study their properties, such as degree distributions, community structure, and assortativity.
- **Modified Preferential Attachment Model**: Explore a modified version of the preferential attachment model that incorporates age-based penalties for node selection.
- **Random Walk Simulations**: Simulate random walks on ER and preferential attachment networks, analyzing the distance traveled by the walker, the degree distribution of visited nodes, and the influence of network properties.
- **PageRank Implementation**: Implement the PageRank algorithm using random walks and study the relationship between node degrees and PageRank scores.
- **Personalized PageRank**: Explore personalized PageRank, where the user's interest is incorporated into the ranking process, and analyze the effects of biased teleportation on PageRank scores.
